<p>
Tomato has long served as model system for fleshy fruit development,
and is an excellent system to study cell wall proteins as it is
associated with dramatic changes in wall biology, including
enzyme-mediated cell wall polysaccharide degradation, apoplastic sugar
metabolism and extracellular defenses against microbial
pathogens. However, there are few published proteomic analyses of
ripening tomato fruit and most of those are based on extraction of
total proteins followed by 2-DE separation, and the wall proteome was
not the major target. Consequently, the protein extraction step was
not optimized for secreted proteins.

  </p>

<p>
Similarly, defense responses against pathogens are also fundamentally
associated with changes in the expression of secreted apoplastic
proteins, but there have been few systematic studies at the proteome
level.
</p>

<p>
  We have been developing methods to obtain sample materials highly
  enriched in apoplast/cell wall proteins, including vacuum
  dehydration, centrifugal dehydration and several methods that
  involve the centrifugal isolation of the cell wall followed by
  sequential extraction with solutions of increasing ionic
  strength. Taken together, the goal is to create a more comprehensive
  catalog of the tomato cell wall proteome, focusing on fruit and
  leaves at various stages of infection by the oomycete Phytophthora
  infestans. This will include both protein identification and
  quantitative data, to gain insights into the dynamic properties of
  the tomato secretome. Additionally we have been profiling "total
  proteomes"; and screening the resulting protein populations for those
  known to be localized in the cell wall with a predicted secretory
  signal peptide, or that are <a href="/secretom/detail/glycoproteome">glycosylated</a>.
</p>

<p>
  We have been applying several approaches for comparative proteomic
  analysis, including Difference Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE), isobaric
  Tag Relative Absolute Protein Quantitation (iTRAQ), exponentially
  modified protein abundance index (emPAI) and MSE. The latter two
  approaches were found to provide accurate relative quantitation data
  on par with that provided by iTRAQ at significantly reduced cost,
  but without the ability to multiplex. They have been integrated into
  our work flow and are used where appropriate. We have also developed
  a high/low pH reverse phase-reverse phase (RP-RP) separation
  protocol to fractionate peptides prior to MS analysis. This new
  approach complements the traditional strong cation exchange (SCX) RP
  strategy and the Offgel peptide IEF fractionation.

  We are characterizing the dynamics of host-pathogen secretomes in

  <p>
  We are profiling the cell wall proteome of ripening tomato fruit,
  contrasting those of wild type (cv. Ailsa Craig) and several
  ripening impaired mutants: ripening inhibitor (rin), non-ripening
  (Nor) and never ripe (Nr). While the genes responsible for all these
  mutations have been cloned, and important progress has been made in
  elucidating their respective signaling pathways, numerous aspects
  remain poorly understood and the degree of regulatory complexity and
  the multiplicity of underlying molecular mechanisms have far
  exceeded expectations.
