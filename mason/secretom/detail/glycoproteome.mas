  As with all eukaryotes, N-glycosylation in plant cells is a common
  post-translational modification for proteins traveling through the
  secretory pathway, many of which are destined for the cell wall. The
  large-scale isolation and analysis of glycoproteins by lectin
  affinity chromatography, coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), has
  become a powerful tool to evaluate the glycoproteome of mammalian
  cells; however, is has rarely been used with plants glycoproteins.
  </p>

  <p>
  We are using affinity selection of glycoproteins using the lectin
  Concanavalin A, coupled with two-dimensional liquid chromatography
  (2-D LC) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass
  spectrometry (2DLC-MALDI MS/MS) and electrospray ionization MS
  (ESI-MS) analysis, to identify extracellular and secretory pathway
  proteins, focusing on those expressed in ripe tomato fruit.

  Tomato has long served as model system for fleshy fruit development
  and ripening is an excellent system to study cell wall proteins as it
  is associated with dramatic changes in wall biology, including
  dramatic enzyme-mediated cell wall polysaccharide degradation,
  apoplastic sugar metabolism and extracellular defenses against
  microbial pathogens. In spite of this, there are few published
  proteomic analyses of ripening tomato fruit and most of those are
  based on extraction of total proteins followed by 2-DE separation,
  since the wall proteome was not the major target. Consequently, the
  protein extraction step was not optimized for secreted proteins.

<&| /page/info_section.mas, title => 'Objectives', is_subsection => 0 &>
  <ul>
    <li>
     Develop lectin affinity chromatography protocols to optimize
     extraction of plant glycoproteins.
    </li>
    <li>
     Evaluate various MS strategies for effective identification of
     glycoproteins, including MALDI and ESI associated strategies.
    </li>
    <li>
     Generate a catalog of annotated tomato glycoproteins, focusing on
     fruit development, including identification of glycosylation sites.
    </li>
    <li>
     Confirm localization using transient expression as fluorescent
     fusion proteins in onion epidermal cells.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  This enrichment strategy has been highly effective, with a high
  proportion the identified proteins showing predicted localization
  either in the secretory pathway. We are currently investigating the
  targeting of proteins form the secretory pathway to other
  intracellular organelles.
