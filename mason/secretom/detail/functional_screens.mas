<&| /page/info_section.mas, title => 'Yeast Secretion Trap (YST) Screen' &>

  <p>
  We have been developing and applying functional screens to identify
  genes encoding secreted proteins. The genes are identified based on
  the ultimate localization of the encoded protein, utilizing protein
  markers whose activities confirm targeting to the cell surface.

  <p>
  The YST screen can be used to test a specific cDNA of interest, or to
  screen a cDNA library.  The screen uses invertase, an enzyme that
  hydrolyzes sucrose to generate glucose and fructose, as a reporter
  gene/protein and yeast (<span class="species_binomial">S. cerevisiae</span>)
  as a host. If yeast cells are streaked onto plates containing sucrose
  as the sole carbon source, they must secrete invertase to break down
  the sucrose in order to grow, and so an invertase-deficient yeast
  mutant will be unable to grow.

  This system can also identify plasma membrane (PM)-spanning or
  PM-anchored proteins if the orientation of the fusion protein is such
  that the invertase component is external to the cell. The resulting
  yeast transformants can then be isolated and the plasmids containing
  the heterologous transgenes sequenced, allowing identification of the
  secreted protein. We typically also confirm the localization of
  candidates of interest by transient expression as GFP fusion proteins
  in onion epidermal cells, coupled with staining using the FM-64 dye to
  co-stain for the plasma membrane,

  </div>

  <p>
  We have also developed a new technique termed the NIP secretion trap
  screen. Briefly, this involves ligating cDNAs in frame at the 5&rsquo;
  end of the DNA sequence encoding a gene termed necrosis-inducing
  protein (NIP) that has been truncated to remove the native secretory
  signal peptide. NIP was identified from the oomycete Phytophthora
  sojae, as a protein that induces a hypersensitive response (HR),
  resulting in cell death, in leaves of some plants when present in the
  apoplast. It does not cause HR when expressed in the plant
  cytosol. Constructs containing individual cDNA::Nip fusions are
  transformed into <span class="species_binomial">Agrobacterium
  tumefaciens</span>, which is then infiltrated into the apoplastic
  compartment of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Any proteins encoding SPs
  will be secreted from infected plant cells as NIP fusion proteins,
  causing a readily detectable HR.
  </p>

  <p>
  The Nip fusion assay is a convenient and rapid means to confirm
  secretion of proteins in planta and complements the YST screen.

  <p>
  To date we have identified both known cell wall localized proteins as
  well as a number of proteins whose presence in the apoplast is
  unexpected, based on functional annotation, or the absence of a
  predicted secretory signal peptide, suggesting alternative
  non-canonical secretion pathways, as have describe in yeast and
  mammalian cells. We have also identified several proteins that show
  dual localization in the wall an intracellular compartments, and we
  are now characterizing some of the complexity in the secretory
  pathway.
