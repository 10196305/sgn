  Plant cell walls are typically considered as complex structural
  matrices that surround all plant cells. They consist mostly of
  polysaccharides, but also contain components such as lignin,
  structural lipids and proteins in specialized cell types.

  continuum throughout the plant, also termed the "apoplast", or
  apoplastic compartment.
