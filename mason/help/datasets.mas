<p><b>Working with Datasets</b></p>

<p>Datasets are collections of identifiers that are stored in
the database. Datasets can be composed of accessions, plots, traits, locations,
and trials. Datasets are attached to the individual user’s account, and can
only be created and seen by the user while logged in. SGN databases use of
Datasets in analysis tools on the website such as Wizard, GWAS, GS,
Heritability, and Stability tools.</p>

<p><b>Creating Datasets</b></p>

<p>Datasets are generated in the Wizard. Up to 4 identifiers
can be selected. First select the categories and entries in each column. In
this example we have selected Trials, Accessions, and Genotyping Protocols.
Then enter a name in the “Load/Create Dataset” section. In this example we have
used “Tinker QTL 2021”. After creating the dataset, you can make it public for
others to use by selecting first selecting the dataset using the “Load Dataset”
list then selecting the “Make Public” button. </p>

<p><b>Retrieving Datasets</b></p>

<p>To retrieve a dataset in the Wizard, select the dataset in
the “Load Dataset” input then select the “Load” button. This will populate the
columns in the Wizard and then allow you to download and analyze the dataset.</p>

<p><b>Searching Datasets</b></p>

<p>To search for a dataset, select the “Datasets” link in the
toolbar at the top right of the website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Datasets can also be used in publications for linking available
data. Copy the URL from the detail page found in the Search Datasets
page.</p>
