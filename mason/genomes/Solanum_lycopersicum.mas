The tomato genome sequencing project was begun in 2004 by an
international consortium including participants from Korea, China, the
United Kingdom, India, the Netherlands, France, Japan, Spain, Italy
and the United States.  The initial approach was to sequence only the
euchromatic sequence using a BAC-by-BAC approach, and in total more
than 1,200 BACs were sequenced. In 2009, a whole-genome shotgun
approach was initiated, which in conjunction with other data yielded
high quality assemblies. The ITAG consortium has annotated the
different builds generated by the two approaches. Please note that all
data is released under the data release agreement below.
