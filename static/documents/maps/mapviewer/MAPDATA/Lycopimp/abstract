Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium Inbred Backcross Lines (IBLs)

This  consensus map was constructed from the three populations derived from the cross L. esculentum cv. E6203 x L. pimpinellifolium LA1589 BC1, BC2 and BCRILs ( Grandillo and Tanksley, 1996; Tanksley et al. 1996, Doganlar et al. 2002).  The map contains 151 markers covering the entire tomato genome, cM values are based the ----1992 map.   Next to each marker on the map is the restriction enzyme used to detect the RLFP in this population.
A  subset of 100 IBLs (inbred backcross lines) giving the most uniform genome coverage and map resolution will be made available through Tomato Genetics Resource Center at UC Davis (http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu).
