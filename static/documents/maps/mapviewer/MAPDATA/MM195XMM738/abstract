The map is based on 58 F2 plants from an interspecific cross between S. linnaeanum (MM195) and
S. melongena (MM738) and contains 233 RFLP markers.  S. linnaeanum is a spiny wild relative of
cultivated eggplant and bears small, green, striped, round fruit.  S. melongena MM738 is a
non-spiny commercial type eggplant line that bears large, purple, unstriped, oblong fruit.
Tomato cDNA, genomic DNA and COS (conserved ortholog set) RFLP markers that were primarily single
copy were mapped to allow comparative genome analysis between eggplant, tomato, potato and pepper.
The map, this comparative analysis and its implications for genome evolution in the Solanaceae are
presented and discussed in Doganlar et al. (2002a).  In addition, the map was used for QTL analysis
to identify genes for domestication (Doganlar et al. 2002b) and other morphological (Frary et al.
2002) traits that have been functionally conserved during evolution and domestication of the family.
