<p>
This is a composite map based on a L. esculentum x L. pennellii F2 
population and reported in Tanksley et al (1992).   The map has been 
updated periodically and includes DNA markers, isozyme markers and 
some morphological markers.  However, it does not contain the most 
recent COS markers and microsatellites which you can find on the 
<a href='map.pl?mapName=1'>Tomato-EXPEN 2000</a> map.</p>
