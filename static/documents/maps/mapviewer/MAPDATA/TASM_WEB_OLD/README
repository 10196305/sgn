This README is to be annotated from an email Anita is sending to Robert.
Further details to follow.

Note on entering TASM_WEB_OLD chromosomal data into the data entry.
* all data in () have an offset of 0 and a confidence level of I.
* all data in () correspond to the previous marker.
* all symbols are ignored in this particular data entry.
* when there are more than 2 offsets within one marker section, the offsets are  corresponded with the markers that are aligned.
* all markers that do not have an offset will automatically assumed to have an
  offset of 1.0
