Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium Inbred Backcross Lines (IBLs)
A set of 196 inbred-backcross lines (IBLs) (BC2F6) was generated from a population which had been developed as part of an AB-QTL strategy to identify useful alleles from a small red fruited wild relative of tomato, Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium LA1589 (Grandillo and Tanksley, 1996; Tanksley et al. 1996).  The population has been mapped with 127 markers covering the tomato genome (Doganlar et al 2002).  Each of the IBL contains more than one introgressed region from L. pimpinellifolium in the L. esculentum cv. E6203 background.  The IBLs are a permanent mapping resource that can be used by tomato geneticists and breeders for mapping, gene discovery and breeding.
A consensus map was constructed from the three studies that used populations derived from the original L. esculentum cv. E6203 x L. pimpinellifolium LA1589 cross Grandillo and Tanksley, 1996; Tanksley et al. 1996, Doganlar et al. 2002).  The map contains 151 markers covering the entire tomato genome, cM values are based on the  map of Tanksley et al. (1996).
To improve the utility of the IBL population, a subset of 100 lines giving the most uniform genome coverage and map resolution was selected using a randomized greedy algorithm as implemented in the software package MapPop (Vision et al. 2001) (http://genome.cornell.edu/software.html).  The seed for the selected subset of 100 IBLs will be available through the Tomato Genetics Resource Center (http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu, TGRC, Davis, CA).
The mapping and QTL data for the IBLs are also available through the below links.
